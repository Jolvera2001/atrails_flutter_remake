# ATrails

ATrails was one of my first big Swift apps that was built to be a sort of social media platform for people on hiking trails. With only a month to develop it, I was able to create a whole post system connected to a Firebase Backend with a lot of other features planned. Although I don't have access to Swift now, I've decided to remake the app using Dart and Flutter, and this will also be a way for me to learn more about using Dart and building mobile apps again.
